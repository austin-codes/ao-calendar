== Description ==
The concept behind the AO Calendar is to create a simple calendar plugin for WordPress. Ideally, this plugin is coded in such a way that we, and others, can create plugin add-ons that would integrate your desired event management systems into AO Calendar.

== Installation ==

2. Upload the zip file to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Unzip
4. Activate the plugin through the plugins page of the WordPress dashboard.
